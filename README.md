This is my repository for several notable projects undertaken while in my grad program at Northwestern.

* **HPC** contains the C files modeling Monte Carlo integration and simulating the [Allen-Cahn equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%E2%80%93Cahn_equation) using MPI
(an interface widely used in parallel computing), as well as analysis of the strong/weak scaling of my algorithms

* **Predictive Analytics** contains the analysis and discussion of a final course project, in which we used multiple linear and logistic
regression in order to predict catalog sales. The analysis was carried out in R.

* **compbio_class** contains a final course project for a Principles of Computational Biology course, in which I analyze an alternative
sampling strategy for Bayesian network topology reconstruction

* **ml_class** contains several different exercises and course projects that I completed in various courses covering deep and
reinforcement learning. In particular, see **ml_class/Reinforce_hw_2_JoelEliason/exercise_4-Cartpole_JoelEliason.ipynb** for an example
of deep Q reinforcement learning for solving the cartpole problem using Keras/Tensorflow, and **ml_class/dl_scratch/course_project.ipynb** for a final course project
in which I use PyTorch to analyze the effects of various forms of randomness in neural network training.
